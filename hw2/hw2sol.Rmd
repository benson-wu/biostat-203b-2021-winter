Use tidyverse (ggpot2, dplyr) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic-iv.mit.edu) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat203b-2021winter.github.io/hw/hw1/hw1.html). (Note, I set this chunk to not evaluate becuase I am knitting this markdown file from my local instead of the teaching server.)

## Q2. `read.csv` (base R) vs `read_csv` (tidyverse) vs `fread` (data.table)

There are quite a few utilities in R for reading data files. Let us test the speed of reading a moderate sized compressed csv file, `admissions.csv.gz`, by three programs: `read.csv` in base R, `read_csv` in tidyverse, and `fread` in the popular data.table package. Is there any speed difference?

In this homework, we stick to the tidyverse. 


#### Solution
We can use the library `tictoc` to measure code run time. 

```{r}
tic("read.csv")
df1 <- read.csv(str_c(mimic_path,"/core/admissions.csv.gz"))
toc()

tic("read_csv")
df2 <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_path,"/core/admissions.csv.gz"))
toc()

tic("data.table")
df3 <- fread(str_c(mimic_path,"/core/admissions.csv.gz")) 
toc()
```

`fread` reads the compressed file the fastest among the three functions. It takes about 2.5 seconds. 

We will remove the other data frames and only keep the first for the rest of the assignment. 

```{r}
df_admissions <- df1
remove("df1", "df2", "df3")
```


## Q3. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. Summarize following variables using appropriate numerics or graphs:   

- how many unique `stay_id`?  
- how many unique `subject_id`?  
- length of ICU stay  
- first ICU unit  
- last ICU unit  

#### Solution

Let's read in the ICU stays data first.
```{r}
df_icu <- fread(str_c(mimic_path,"/icu/icustays.csv.gz"))
```

**Stay ID**
```{r}
n_distinct(df_icu$stay_id)
```
There are 69,619 distinct stay ID values.

**Subject ID**
```{r}
n_distinct(df_icu$subject_id)
```
There are 50,048 distinct subject ID values.


**Length of ICU stay**
```{r warning=FALSE}
summary(df_icu$los)
```
After exploring the distribution, it seems like the data is skewed to the right. We can use a log transformation to normalize the length of ICU stays. 

```{r}
df_icu %>% ggplot(aes(log(los))) + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..)) + 
           xlab("Logarithm of Length of ICU Stay (Days)") 

```

**First ICU unit**
```{r}
df_icu %>% ggplot(aes(x=factor(first_careunit))) + 
        geom_bar() + 
        xlab("First ICU unit") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1)) + 
        geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), size=2, vjust=-0.1)  
```
There are 11 distinct First ICU units. The frequency counts are visualized and labeled with the frequqency counts for each unit. The MICU seems to be the most common first ICU unit. 

**Last ICU unit**
```{r}
df_icu %>% ggplot(aes(x=factor(last_careunit))) + 
        geom_bar() + 
        xlab("Last ICU unit") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1)) + 
        geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), size=2, vjust=-0.1)
```
There are 9 distinct last ICU units. The frequency counts are visualized and labeled with the frequqency counts for each unit. The MICU seems to be the most common last ICU unit. 


## Q4. `admission` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `ADMISSION.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. Summarize following variables using appropriate graphs. Explain any patterns you observe.   

- admission year  
- admission month  
- admission month day  
- admission week day  
- admission hour (anything unusual?)  
- number of deaths in each year  
- admission type  
- number of admissions per patient  
- admission location  
- discharge location  
- insurance  
- language  
- martial status  
- ethnicity  
- death 

Note it is possible that one patient (uniquely identified by the `SUBJECT_ID`) is admitted into hospital multiple times. When summarizing some demographic information, it makes sense to summarize based on unique patients. 


#### Solution

**Admission year**
```{r}
#Parse the year out of the admission time
df_admissions$admit_year <- year(df_admissions$admittime)

df_admissions %>% ggplot(aes(x=admit_year)) + 
                  stat_count(geom='line', aes(y=..count..)) +
                  xlab("Admit year") +
                  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 20) +
                  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1)) 

```

The admit year is parsed from the `admittime` variable. The count of individuals in each admit year is visualized in a line chart to examine the trends in ICU admissions over the years. The amount of people admitted seem to increase until about 2030 and then stabilize until 2189. Starting from 2190, the number of admissions significantly decrease. 

**Admission month**
```{r}
#Parse the month out of the admission time
df_admissions$admit_month <- month(df_admissions$admittime)

months <-c("Jan.", "Feb.", "Mar.","Apr.","May", "June", 
           "July", "Aug.", "Sept.", "Oct.", "Nov.", "Dec.")
df_admissions %>% ggplot(aes(x=factor(admit_month))) + geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Admit month") + scale_x_discrete(labels=months) +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1)) +
        geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), size=2, vjust=-0.1)
```

The admit month is parsed from the `admittime` variable. The count of each admission month is visualized in a bar graph to see the count of ICU admissions over the different months of the year. The admission months are relatively uniformly distributed. 

**Admission month day**
```{r}
#Parse day of the month from admittime
df_admissions$admit_month_day <- mday(df_admissions$admittime)
df_admissions %>% ggplot(aes(x=factor(admit_month_day))) + 
        geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Admit month day") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1))
```
The day of the month is parsed from the `admittime` variable. There seem to be a uniform amount of admissions from the 1st to 28th of each month, but there are fewer admissions 29th-31st compared to the other days. There could be especially fewer admissions on the 31st because there are only 7 months with 31 days. 

**Admission week day**
```{r}
#Parse day of the week from admittime
df_admissions$admit_week_day <- wday(df_admissions$admittime)

#X axis labels
days <-c("Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thurs", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")

df_admissions %>% ggplot(aes(x=factor(admit_week_day))) + 
        geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Admit week day") + scale_x_discrete(labels=days) +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, size= 3, hjust=1)) 
```

The day of the week is parsed from the `admittime` variable. The day of the week that individuals are admitted are uniformly distributed. 

**Admission hour**
```{r}
#Parse admission hour from admittime
df_admissions$admit_hour <- hour(df_admissions$admittime)

df_admissions %>% ggplot(aes(x=factor(admit_hour))) + geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Admission hour") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1))
```

The admission hour is parsed from the `admittime` variable. Peak admissions seem to happen between midnight and 1 AM. There is also a sudden spike in admissions between the 7AM and 8 AM and then admission steadily rise over the next few hours towards the evening.

**Number of deaths in each year**
```{r}
df_admissions$death_year <- year(ymd_hms(df_admissions$deathtime))


df_admissions %>% distinct(., subject_id, .keep_all=TRUE) %>%
                  ggplot(aes(x=death_year)) + geom_bar(stat="count") + 
                  xlab("Death year") +
                  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1)) +
                  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 20) 
```
Death year was parsed from the `deathtime` variable. To visualize the deaths per year,the data was restricted to unique patients to ensure that a patient's death was not counted multiple times. Starting from 2190, there seems to be a sharp decrease in the count of deaths per year. 

**Admission type** 
```{r}
df_admissions %>% ggplot(aes(x=factor(admission_type))) + 
        geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Admit type") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1)) + 
        geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), size=2, vjust=-0.1)
```

The most common admission type is EW Emergency. 

**Number of admissions per patient** 
```{r}
#Create a data frame that contains the count of appeareances for each subject ID
df_admissions_count <- df_admissions %>% count(subject_id) 

#Graph counts
df_admissions_count %>% ggplot(aes(x=factor(n))) + geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Count of admission") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,size=6)) 
```
The documentation for the admission data states that "It is possible for this table to have duplicate `subject_id`, indicating that a single patient had multiple admissions to the hospital." Therefore, we can count how many times a unique subject ID shows up in the data to get count of admissions. After plotting the count of admission, we can observe that the distribution of the count of admissions is skewed to the right. 


**Admission location**  
```{r}
#Recode those with blanks and "information not avaliable" to NA
df_admissions$admission_location[df_admissions$admission_location == ""] <- NA
df_admissions$admission_location[df_admissions$admission_location == 
                                   "INFORMATION NOT AVAILABLE"] <- NA

df_admissions %>% drop_na(admission_location) %>%
        ggplot(aes(x=factor(admission_location))) + 
        geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Admit location") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1)) + 
        geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), size=2, vjust=-0.1)
```
Those who had blank values or "INFORMATION NOT AVAILABLE" were recoded to missing for this visualization. The most common admission location is the emergency room. 

**Discharge location**  
```{r}
#Recode those with blanks and "information not available" to NA
df_admissions$discharge_location[df_admissions$discharge_location == ""] <- NA

df_admissions %>% drop_na(discharge_location) %>%
        ggplot(aes(x=factor(discharge_location))) + 
        geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Discharge location") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1)) + 
        geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), size=2, vjust=-0.1)
```
 Those who had blank values were recoded to missing. The most common discharge location is at home. 
 
**Insurance** 
```{r}
df_admissions %>% distinct(., subject_id, .keep_all=TRUE) %>%
        ggplot(aes(x=factor(insurance))) + 
        geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Insurance") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1)) + 
        geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), size=5, vjust=-0.1)
``` 
We examined unique patients for this visualization to avoid counting insurance for subjects who appeared in the data multiple times. Other insurance was the most common type of insurance.

**Language**
```{r}
df_admissions$language_new <- recode(df_admissions$language, 
                                    "?" = "NOT ENGLISH")

df_admissions %>% distinct(., subject_id, .keep_all=TRUE) %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x=factor(language_new))) + 
        geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Language") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1)) + 
        geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), size=5, vjust=-0.1) + 
        scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
``` 

Those who had a "?" as a value were recoded to "Not English", as the other category in this variable is "English." Additionally, we only examined unique patients for this visualization to avoid counting subjects who appeared multiple times in the data. A majority of the patients spoke English. 

**Martial status** 
```{r}
#Turn all blanks into NA
df_admissions$marital_status[df_admissions$marital_status == ""] <- NA

df_admissions %>% drop_na(marital_status) %>%
        distinct(., subject_id, .keep_all=TRUE) %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x=factor(marital_status))) + 
        geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Marital Status") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1)) + 
        geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), size=4, vjust=-0.1)
```  

Those who had a blank as a value were recoded to missing. Additionally, we only examined unique patients for this visualization to counting subjects who appeared multiple times in the data. Most of the patients were either married or single. 

**Ethnicity**  
```{r}
#Recode those who are "UNKNOWN" or "UNABLE TO OBTAIN" as missing
df_admissions$ethnicity[df_admissions$ethnicity == "UNKNOWN"] <- NA
df_admissions$ethnicity[df_admissions$ethnicity == "UNABLE TO OBTAIN"] <- NA

df_admissions %>% distinct(., subject_id, .keep_all=TRUE) %>% 
        drop_na(ethnicity) %>%
        ggplot(aes(x=factor(ethnicity))) + 
        geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Ethnicity") +
        theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60,hjust=1)) + 
        geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), size=3, vjust=-0.1)
``` 
Individuals who ethnicity was unknown or unable to be obtained were ommitted from this visualization. Additionally, we only examined unique patients for this visualization to counting subjects who appeared multiple times in the data. A majority of the patients in this data were White. 

**Death**
```{r}
df_admissions %>% distinct(., subject_id, .keep_all=TRUE) %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x=factor(hospital_expire_flag))) + 
        scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Survived until discharge", 
                                  "Death in hospital")) +
        geom_bar(stat="count") + 
        xlab("Death") +
        geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), size=5, vjust=-0.1)
```
We only examined unique patients for this visualization to counting subjects who appeared multiple times in the data. Most patients survived until discharge from the hospital. 



## Q5. `patient` data

Explore `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/patients/>) and summarize following variables using appropriate numerics and graphs:  

- `gender`  
- `anchor_age` (explain pattern you see)

#### Solution

**Gender**
```{r}
df_patients <- fread(str_c(mimic_path, "/core/patients.csv.gz")) 

df_patients %>% distinct(., subject_id, .keep_all=TRUE) %>% 
                ggplot(aes(x=factor(gender))) + geom_bar(stat="count") + 
                xlab("Gender") + scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Female", "Male")) + 
                geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=..count..), 
                          size=5, vjust=-0.1)
```

Unique subjects were examined to avoid counting patients multiple times. There are more females than males in this dataset. 

**Anchor age**
```{r}
df_patients %>% ggplot(aes(anchor_age)) + geom_histogram() + 
        xlab("Age in anchor year") 
```

There are a lot of people who report an age of 0 during the anchor year. Perhaps 0 may represent a missing value? Then there are two peaks in the anchor age for individuals in their late teens/early 20's and for individuals in their 50's.

## Q6. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. 

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), glucose (50931), magnesium (50960), calcium (50893), and lactate (50813). Find the `itemid`s of these lab measurements from `d_labitems.csv.gz` and retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` only containing these items.


#### Solution

First take a look at first lines of the labevents data.
```{r}
system(str_c("zcat < ", 
             shQuote(str_c(mimic_path, "/hosp/labevents.csv.gz")), " | head"), 
             intern = TRUE)
```

`fread` doesn't work due to memory issues. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
df_labevents <- fread(str_c(mimic_path, "/hosp/labevents.csv.gz"))
```

Let's try selecting only a few columns and running on local machine. Code is courtesy of Dr. Zhou. 
```{r}

if(!file.exists("labevents_icustays.csv.gz")){
 system.time(df_labevents <-
        fread(str_c(mimic_path, "/hosp/labevents.csv.gz"),
           select = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "itemid",
                 "charttime", "valuenum"),
           nThread = 4))
 df_labevents %>%
  #Filter for rows that contain matching subject_id and hadm_id in ICU data 
  semi_join(df_icu, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  #Write this reduced dataframe to a csv file
  fwrite("labevents_icustays.csv.gz", nThread = 4)
}

#Remove the lab events dataframe (if present) to clear memory 
remove("df_labevents")

#Read reduced data file
system.time(df_labevents <- fread("labevents_icustays.csv.gz", nThread = 4))
```

Let's read in the dictionary for the lab items
```{r}
df_d_labitems <- fread(str_c(mimic_path, 
                             "/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz"), nThread = 4)
```

This is the quick way to do this question. The lab IDs for the desired lab measurements are given in the question.
```{r}
#Subset labevents data containing desired item IDs
df_labevents_subset <- subset(df_labevents, itemid %in% c("50912", "50971", 
                                  "50983","50902", "50882", "51221", "51301", 
                                  "50931", "50960", "50893", "50813")) %>% 
  mutate(charttime = ymd_hms(charttime)) 
```

However, if we weren't provided with the item IDs we can use this method to search for the item IDs based off of the key words. Code is courtesy of Dr. Zhou. 
```{r}
#Create a vector containing the key words
labitems <- c("creatinine", "potassium", "sodium", "chloride",
              "bicarbonate", "hematocrit", "white blood cell", 
              "glucose", "magnesium", "calcium", "lactate")

#Create an empty vector that is the length of labitems
itemids <- rep(0, length(labitems))
i<-1

#Loop through each lab item
for(labitem in labitems){
  print(str_interp("search for ${labitem}"))
  
  #Search for the item IDs that contain these keywords and store in list 
  itemid_list <- df_d_labitems %>%
    filter(str_detect(label, regex(labitem, ignore_case = T))) %>%
    .$itemid
  
  #In each item list, retreive the one with the most occurences in labevents
  itemid <-  df_labevents %>%
    filter(itemid %in% itemid_list) %>%
    count(itemid) %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    slice(1) %>%
      .$itemid 
    itemids[i] <- itemid
    i <- i+1
}
```

Create a tibble that contains the item IDs and item names 
```{r}
labitem_itemid <- tibble(itemid = itemids, labitem = labitems) %>% 
  print(width=Inf)
```
```

Then we can filter for rows in `labevents_icustays.csv.gz` that contain only these items. The resulting dataframe is the same as the one that is produced from the short cut method when we are given the item IDs. 
```{r}
df_labevents_subset <- df_labevents %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  #Retain only the items containing the desired itemid
  filter(itemid %in% labitem_itemid$itemid) %>%
  #Turn charttime into datetime format
  mutate(charttime = ymd_hms(charttime))
```

## Q7. Vitals from chartered events

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate, mean and systolic blood pressure (invasive and noninvasive measurements combined), body temperature, SpO2, and respiratory rate. Find the `itemid`s of these vitals from `d_items.csv.gz` and retrieve a subset of `chartevents.csv.gz` only containing these items.

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `itemid` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `value` variable is the value measured for `itemid`.

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `itemid` in `chartevents.csv.gz`.

#### Solution

Let's read in the dictionary for the item IDs in `chartevents.csv.gz`
```{r}
df_d_items<-fread(str_c(mimic_path, "/icu/d_items.csv.gz"), nThread = 4) 
```

Let's find the item IDs of the following variables: heart rate, mean and systolic blood pressure (invasive and noninvasive measurements combined), body temperature, SpO2, and respiratory rate.
```{r results = 'hide'}
df_d_items %>%
  filter(str_detect(str_to_lower(label), "heart rate"))
#220045 - Heart Rate
df_d_items %>%
  filter(str_detect(str_to_lower(label), "blood pressure"))
#220052 - Arterial blood pressure mean 
#220050 - Arterial blood pressure systolic 
#220181	- Non Invasive Blood Pressure mean
#220179	- Non Invasive Blood Pressure systolic

df_d_items %>%
  filter(str_detect(str_to_lower(label), "temperature"))
#223761	- Temperature Fahrenheit

df_d_items %>%
  filter(str_detect(str_to_lower(label), "O2 saturation"))
#220277 -	O2 saturation pulseoxymetry

df_d_items %>%
  filter(str_detect(str_to_lower(label), "respiratory rate"))
#220210 -	Respiratory Rate

```

Or we can also do it the way that it was done in lecture to streamline the search process more. Code is courtesy of Dr. Zhou. 
```{r}
chartitems <- c("heart rate", "Blood pressure mean", "systolic", 
                "temperature", "O2 saturation", "respiratory rate")

for(chartitem in chartitems){
  print(str_interp("search for ${chartitem}"))
  df_d_items %>% filter(str_detect(label, regex(chartitem, ignore_case = T))) 
}
```

*Item IDs*
- For heart rate, we will use item ID 220045 with the label "Heart Rate"
- For mean blood pressure, we will use item ID 220052 with the label "Arterial blood pressure mean". Arterial blood pressure is synonymous for blood pressure. 
- For systolic blood pressure, we will use item ID 220050 with the label Arterial blood pressure systolic 
- For non-invasive mean blood pressure, we will use item ID 220181 with the label "Non Invasive Blood Pressure mean"
- For non-invasive systolic blood pressure, we will use item ID 220179 with the label "Non Invasive Blood Pressure systolic"
- For temperature, we will use item ID 223761 with the label "Temperature Fahrenheit". We could have chosen the celsius version, but we will use the fahrenheit version for this assignment. 
- For SpO2, we will use item ID 220277 with the label "O2 saturation pulseoxymetry". A Pulse oximetry measure oxygen saturation levels, so this variable is appropriate for SpO2. 
- For respiratory rate, we will use item ID 220210 with the label Respiratory Rate


Let's try to read in the `chartevents_short.csv.gz` data now. 

Trial 1: Cannot read this in R even on my local machine. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
if(!file.exists("chartevents_short.csv.gz")){
 system.time(df_chartevents <-
        fread(str_c(mimic_path, "/icu/chartevents.csv.gz"),
           select = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "itemid",
                 "charttime", "valuenum"),
           nThread = 4))
 # df_chartevents %>%
 #  semi_join(df_icu, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
 #  fwrite("chartevents_short.csv.gz", nThread = 4)
}
# system.time(df_labevents <- fread("chartevents_short.csv.gz", nThread = 4))
# df_labevents %>%
#  as.tibble() %>%
#  print(width = Inf)
```

Trial 2:We will use Dr. Zhou's bash script to create a filtered `chartevents_filtered_itemid.csv.gz`. I ran this script on my local to generate the data.
```{bash, eval=FALSE, engine="sh"}
zcat < chartevents.csv.gz | awk -F, '{OFS = ","} {if ($6 == 220045 || \
$6 == 220052 || $6 == 220050 || $6 == 220181 || $6 == 220179 || \
$6 == 223761 || $6 == 220277 || $6 == 220210) print $1, $2, $3, $4, $6, $8}' | \
gzip > chartevents_filtered_itemid.csv.gz
```

Read in filtered data set that contains the subset of `chartevents_short.csv.gz` with the desired items.
```{r}
df_chartevents <- fread(str_c(mimic_derived_path, 
                              "/chartevents_filtered_itemid.csv.gz"), 
                        header=FALSE,
                        col.names = c("subject_id", 
                                      "hadm_id", 
                                      "stay_id", 
                                      "charttime", 
                                      "itemid", 
                                      "valuenum"),
                        nThread=4)

as_tibble(df_chartevents) %>% 
  mutate_at(c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "stay_id", "itemid"), as.numeric) %>%
  mutate(charttime=ymd_hms(charttime))

```

Create a tibble that contains the item IDs and item names 
```{r}
chartevents_itemid <- tibble(itemid = c(220045, 220052, 220050, 220181, 
                                        220179, 223761, 220277, 220210),
                            labitem = c("heart_rate", "arterial_BP_mean", 
                            "arterial_BP_sys", "noninvasive_bp", 
                            "noninvasive_bp_sys", "temperature_far", "SpO2", 
                            "respiratory_rate")) %>%
  print(width=Inf)
```


## Q8. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble for all ICU stays, where rows are  

- first ICU stay of each unique patient  
- adults (age at admission > 18)  

and columns contains at least following variables

- all variables in `icustays.csv.gz`  
- all variables in `admission.csv.gz`  
- first lab measurements during ICU stay  
- first vitals measurement during ICU stay  
- an indicator variable whether the patient died within 30 days of hospital admission  

#### Solution
First, let's create a dataframe that contains the first ICU stay of each unique patient and patients who are age >18 at admission.
```{r}
df_icu_uniq <- df_icu %>% 
  #Keep unique patients
  group_by(subject_id)  %>%
  #First ICU stay only 
  filter(rank(intime)==1) %>%
  #Ungroup the tibble
  ungroup() %>%
  #keep all the rows in the ICU stay tibble and 
  #then for each row match df_admission by subject_id and hadm_id
  left_join(df_admissions, by=c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  left_join(df_patients, by = "subject_id") %>%
  #only keep adults whose age at admission is >18
  mutate(age_at_adm = year(admittime) - anchor_year + anchor_age) %>%
  filter(age_at_adm > 18) 
```

Now we want to merge this with the lab events data. 
```{r}
df_icu_uniq <- df_labevents_subset %>%
  #only keep subject id + hadm id that are in df_icu_uniq
  semi_join(df_icu_uniq, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id"))  %>% 
  # #pull in the intime of that ICU stay
  left_join(select(df_icu_uniq, subject_id, hadm_id, intime), 
            by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  mutate(intime=ymd_hms(intime)) %>%
  #only keep lab items after ICU intime
  filter(charttime >= intime) %>%
  #group by item id
  group_by(subject_id, itemid) %>%
  #only keep the first charttime for each item
     #Sort according to charttime within each group and 
     #take the top 1 in each sorted group
  arrange(charttime, .by_group=TRUE) %>% slice_head(n=1) %>%
  #We don't need charttime and intime anymore
  select(-charttime, -intime) %>%
  #Turn itemid into columns and assign the values to the variables
  spread(key = itemid, value = valuenum) %>% 
  #Merge with df_icu_uniq
  right_join(df_icu_uniq, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # #More informative column names from Question 6
  rename_at(vars(as.character(labitem_itemid$itemid)), 
                 ~labitem_itemid$labitem) 
```


Now let's merge the data with chartevents to get the first vital measurments during ICU stay

Let's clear some memory in the environment first before running the next chunk. 
```{r}
rm("df_admissions", "df_admissions_count", 
   "df_labevents", "df_labevents_subset")
```

```{r}
df_icu_uniq_final <- 
  df_chartevents %>%
  #only keep subject id + hadm id that are in df_icu_uniq
  semi_join(df_icu_uniq, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id"))  %>% 
  left_join(select(df_icu_uniq, subject_id, hadm_id, intime)
            , by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  #only keep lab items after ICU intime
  filter(charttime >= intime) %>%
  #group by item id
  group_by(subject_id, itemid) %>%
  #only keep the first charttime for each item
     #Sort according to charttime within each group 
     #and take the top 1 in each sorted group
  arrange(charttime, .by_group=TRUE) %>% slice_head(n=1) %>%
  #We don't need charttime and intime anymore
  select(-charttime, -intime) %>%
  #Turn itemid into columns and assign the values to the variables
  spread(key = itemid, value = valuenum) %>% 
  right_join(select(df_icu_uniq,-one_of("stay_id")), 
  by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # #More informative column names from Question 6
  rename_at(vars(as.character(chartevents_itemid$itemid)), 
                 ~chartevents_itemid$labitem) %>%
  #create a var that represents if a patient died within 30 days of admission
  mutate(days_before_death = as.numeric((ymd_hms(deathtime)-ymd_hms(admittime)), 
         units="days")) %>%
  mutate(died_within_30_days = ifelse(days_before_death<=30, 1, 0)) %>%
  print(width=Inf)
```

This dataframe contains the first ICU stay of each patient for those who are age >18 at admission. Additionally, this dataframe contains all variables in `icustays.csv.gz` and `admission.csv.gz` and the first lab and vitals measurements during ICU stay. The indicator variable for whether the patient died within 30 days of hospital admission was created from `deathtime`-`admittime` and then converting the resulting value into days.
